# README

This is a simple rails app (originally just a static website with some javascript).  Users can take a quiz and see products as a result.
Responses are stored as a csv string in the database (hacky, I know).

App is hosted on heroku at doineedaplb.com.

StaticController etc. is inspired by (essentially copied from) Michael Hartl tutorial at https://www.railstutorial.org.

Quiz itself is hardcoded into html and questions appear/disappear via jQuery.  Inspired by working through http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/.
